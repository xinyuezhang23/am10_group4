# Group 4 Final Project
For our data visualization peoject, we are going to study Netflix. We aim to find out the content on Netflix and comapre it with key competitors like Amazon Prime.

# Data
We find data set of [Netflix](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows) and [Amazon Prime](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/amazon-prime-movies-and-tv-shows) on Kaggle. These two data sets contains contents on each platform including title, director, country, release year etc. Inorder to present the story in a complete way and include more interesting facts, we add other quantitive dimensions generated by audience which merged from [IMDb](https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/imdb-extensive-dataset). Besides, we also merged [Netflix subscribers data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17KyqNGvXRL4aIyXsciXJafD-vqLSDhJGtAYd_GJM-Go/edit#gid=0) from different countries to see which country generates the most revenue. 


# Analysis content

## Netflix content analysis
First we go through the data set and want to figure out the following questions:
1. When does Netflix update their content?
2. Where is Netflix’s content from? 
3. Who are Netflix’s most common actors and directors?
4. What about production and revenue split?
5. What are the top ten movies on Netflix?

## Compare Netflix and Amazon Prime
After analysing the basic information of Netflix, we conduct a comparison with Amazon Prime Video.
### Content comparison
1. Are the contents on these two platforms the same? We compare words used in title and description to see the content difference.
2. To provde the above finding, we also compare the show ratings on these two platforms.
### Rating comparison
1. What is the trend in average ratings of contents on these two platforms?
2. Which genre has the highest average rating?
Further more, we build **regression model** to see which factors have the most effect on ratings.
Last but not least, we develop a **content-based recommendation system** for on Netflix data to recommend what should people watch next.

# Key conclusions
**Netflix:**
- Majority of content is from English speaking countries and gets added in winter months
- Top ten movies are all from the USA and India
- Netflix profits from a few directors that produce a lot of content

**The comparison:**
- While Netflix has more diversified content, Amazon focuses on younger audiences
- Older movies enjoy higher ratings on both platforms
- Biographies enjoy highest ratings on both platforms
- Netflix contains higher rated movies on average compared to Prime, as seen through the regression model
